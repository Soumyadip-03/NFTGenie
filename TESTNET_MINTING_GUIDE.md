## üÜì FREE Alternatives (No Verbwire Required)

If Verbwire doesn't work, you can use these free alternatives:

### Option 1: ThirdWeb (Recommended for Testing)
```javascript
// Install: npm install @thirdweb-dev/sdk
import { ThirdwebSDK } from "@thirdweb-dev/sdk";

const sdk = new ThirdwebSDK("polygon-amoy");
// Free minting on testnet
```

### Option 2: Direct Smart Contract (Advanced)
1. Deploy your own NFT contract on Polygon Amoy
2. Use Remix IDE: https://remix.ethereum.org/
3. Deploy ERC-721 contract
4. Mint directly to contract

### Option 3: NFT.Storage + Custom Contract

2. Deploy simple ERC-721 contract
3. Mint with metadata URI

## üö® Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Insufficient funds"
**Solution**: Get more test MATIC from faucet

### Issue: "API key invalid"
**Solution**: 
- Check if keys are activated in Verbwire dashboard
- Ensure you're using testnet keys
- Contact Verbwire support for testnet access

### Issue: "Network error"
**Solution**:
- Switch MetaMask to Polygon Amoy
- Check RPC URL is working
- Try alternative RPC URLs

### Issue: "Transaction failed"
**Solution**:
- Increase gas fees slightly
- Check wallet has test MATIC
- Verify contract address

## üí° Quick Test Without Real Minting

To test the flow without actual blockchain minting:

1. **Mock Mode**: Update backend to return success without calling Verbwire
2. **Local Blockchain**: Use Ganache for local testing
3. **Hardhat**: Run local Polygon fork

## üìù Important Notes

- **Testnet is FREE**: All operations use test tokens
- **Not Real Money**: Test MATIC has no value
- **Reset Anytime**: Can always get new test tokens
- **Practice Safe**: Test everything on testnet first
- **Keep Keys Safe**: Even testnet keys should be protected
